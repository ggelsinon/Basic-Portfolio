           <li>Skater of the Month May 2016</li>
           <li>Kick Ass Kill Scout award Jan 2018</li>
       </ul>

           Slayer looks forward to being drafted to a Home Team this coming May. She hopes to pass the next round of skills testing this year, so that she can start playing with RMRG's C Team Project Mayhem. Mostly though she just loves the people in her derby community, and skating with her people!
