                Slayer (short for Betty Slayer One) began her misadventures in Roller Derby with the Rocky Mountain Rollergirls in May of 2015. Since then her slow steady progress has helped her win recognition from her peers in the form of:
            </p>
            <p>4 MVP awards, Skater of the Month May 2016, and Kick Ass Kill Scout award Jan 2018</p>
            <p>
                Slayer looks forward to being drafted to a Home Team this coming May. She hopes to pass the next round of skills testing this year, so that she can start playing with RMRG's C Team Project Mayhem. Mostly though she just loves the people in her derby community, and skating with her people!

                In her "Skater of the Month" Featured article her peers wrote:
                Slayer’s tenacity and unflinchingly positive attitude are an inspiration to even our most senior skaters, and her willingness to #work on her game is to be admired by all. Even when jobs and other “real life” issues try to get in the way, Slayer stays focused and committed to her goals. She is not afraid to reach out to others who need support, nor does she shy away from asking for it herself. Her ability to reflect on the inherent challenges of the sport and overcome frustrations are enviable, and we can all learn a lot from the way she keeps moving forward, improving her physical and mental game with every practice.
                Slayer’s positive demeanor and infectious work ethic make her an obvious choice for our May Skater of the Month! Congratulations Slayer! We love you and look forward to seeing what great things you do in the future!
